# MPG_Calculator
This application is built by creating a linear prediction model using mtcars dataset.
You can check the effect of Weight, transmission type and acceleration (1/4 mile time) on expected MPG in real-time by adjusting the parameters in the left panel. Expected MPG is shown on the top of the Plot .
Plot shows the relationship between MPG and other parameters based on the historic data, that is used to build the application.
